=================

This is a game in which you catch raindrops with a cat paw. In this game, you move the mouse on the bottom of the screen, and from that, you are able to catch raindrops that are "falling." The raindrops falling will irritate the cat. You have three lives, and if you lose three raindrops in the game, it will say, "Game Over," and display a photo of the infamous grumpy cat.
